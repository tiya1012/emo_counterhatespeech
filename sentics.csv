0,"While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.",POSITIVE
1,"The quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. Isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'Islamic issue'?",NEGATIVE
2,"Gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some Islamic schools. I was 15 before I attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. The issue is really, if we are to allow faith based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements.",POSITIVE
3,"We need to work together to eradicate CSE once and for all. Individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth.",POSITIVE
4,Grooming gangs like those in Rochdale and Huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. Does that look like police collusion to you?,POSITIVE
5,No they are not - prove this?,POSITIVE
6,"The only cover up I remember was in the Catholic Church, but we remember that the actions of individuals do not reflect on the whole.",POSITIVE
7,"Good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-Muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. Oh, wait.",NEGATIVE
8,The only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the BBC or the Church to shield them.,NEGATIVE
9,The only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation.,NEGATIVE
10,"The only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about Muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted.",POSITIVE
11,Is this true? Where is your source?,POSITIVE
12,The BBC also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and Islamophobic crimes. What is your point?,NEGATIVE
13,"Mate, the media is constantly biased against Muslims and tries to make them out to be the enemy. What we hardly ever see is the many more positive stories.",NEGATIVE
14,I thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. Now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction.,POSITIVE
15,I think the government has a very good understanding of who should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them?,POSITIVE
16,"In fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries.",POSITIVE
17,"What happened to the good old British values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches?",POSITIVE
18,An entire faith? Really? Can you not see how ignorant this is?,NEGATIVE
19,Are you blaming all community for the action of a few? Doesn't seem very fair does it?,NEGATIVE
20,"Could you mind your language? You are insulting millions of people who are Muslims. Isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all Muslims?",POSITIVE
21,Positive news stories*.,POSITIVE
22,"Surely it is our 'actions' that make us criminals, not whichever faith we follow, whether that be by choice or tradition or culture?",POSITIVE
23,This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?,POSITIVE
24,Muslims are also average and decent British citizens? Repatriate?,POSITIVE
25,Saying that all people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all.,NEGATIVE
26,"Can I suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the UK does not reflect 'our values' in the way I understand them.",POSITIVE
27,"Isis is an extreme of Islam and does not represent Muslims' belief and action. Indeed, most of Islam condemn the action of ISIS.",NEGATIVE
28,Saying that all Muslims are criminals is just wrong. They also do share British values.,POSITIVE
29,"I agree that ISIS is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the UK is just plain silly.",POSITIVE
30,"Actually, the principle of Muslims is to love and respect everyone. This is the same as our values. If you talk to a Muslim, you will find out that they are kind and friendly people too.",POSITIVE
31,"This is just false news! Islam, Christianity and Judaism have the same beginnings and the Koran give special respect to the other two.",POSITIVE
32,"Whilst a small number of Muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the Muslim anti-extremism march in Cologne)",POSITIVE
33,[find positive and up to date example of Muslim people contributing to their community.] Doesn't really look like it to me.,POSITIVE
34,Kkk anyone? Actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions.,POSITIVE
35,"Google image search to provide factual information about the image if possible. Ie when and where it is from and provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned my main stream Islam and happened 15 years ago.",NEGATIVE
36,Source check?,NEUTRAL
37,There are a hundred similar images of Christian including those in the KKK standing next to their victims who used the Bible as a justification. Of course none of us believe they represent all Christians.,NEGATIVE
38,"[quote from Quran about peace and love.] When the Quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in Islam, how is this a reflection on all Muslims.?",POSITIVE
39,"On a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 Muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror.",NEGATIVE
40,Islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may or may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that .,NEGATIVE
41,"Do an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. Either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion.",NEGATIVE
42,"The image was photoshopped, original here. Muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up.",POSITIVE
43,"Even if true, how does hatred counter hatred?",POSITIVE
44,Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from Koran].,POSITIVE
45,You seem to have a new superpower? Ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name?,POSITIVE
46,"They don't, but I wonder why only the crimes with 'White British Non-Muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated?",NEGATIVE
47,Criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? Seems a lot of bother to me.,NEGATIVE
48,Isn't this a 'Have You Stopped Beating Your Wife?' question.?,NEGATIVE
49,"Tosh! Criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity.",NEGATIVE
50,All hatred is wrong.,POSITIVE
51,"No, the Qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. Seriously, check your facts.",POSITIVE
52,"No, it doesn't.",NEUTRAL
53,"Slavery long predated Islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. Way ahead of the rest of the world.",NEGATIVE
54,But the British turned it into an art form to rape and pillage across the world.,NEGATIVE
55,"That is inaccurate, do your research! Slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world.",NEGATIVE
56,Slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. I am sure the Romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from Muslims.,POSITIVE
57,Slavery was widely dominant before Islam. Muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness.,POSITIVE
58,"That is misleading! The Atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to Christians, but no one calls it Christian slave trade.",NEGATIVE
59,"No, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade.",NEGATIVE
60,Non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. What is your point?,NEGATIVE
61,Christian Europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy.,POSITIVE
62,This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? This is just hatred.,NEGATIVE
63,"That is a misunderstanding. On the contrary, Islam is a peaceful religion and condemns any crimes or violences to anyone.",NEGATIVE
64,I know many Muslims who are wonderful people and have done nothing wrong to this world. You should not insult people based on their religion.,POSITIVE
65,"People have the right to belong to any religion they want. If you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad!",POSITIVE
66,These are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. More about behaviours than matters of doctrine.,NEGATIVE
67,This is not true. How can you say that about 1.6 billion people?,NEGATIVE
68,Biased media coverage over-represents Muslims as committing these crimes. How much media attention does the Vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison?,NEGATIVE
69,"The demonisation of the Muslim community is the real problem here. Comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not Islam.",NEGATIVE
70,"Fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch.",NEGATIVE

74,"Islam has also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. It is impossible to take it out of our life!",NEGATIVE
75,"Rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the Bible. Many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes.",POSITIVE
76,The myth that Muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. Don't believe everything you read.,NEGATIVE
77,I think you are confusing Islam with the crusades.,NEGATIVE
78,You are generalizing too much. Christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! But we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. I think the same is true about Muslims.,POSITIVE
79,"I thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship?",POSITIVE
80,"There are criminals, who are from UK, raping children and murdering people. Maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes.",POSITIVE
81,"Let's have a crusade. Except did not the last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder?",POSITIVE
82,"Muslims aren't rapists or murderers, in fact many Muslims are doing good things to fight the extremists falsely appropriating Islam: https://5pillarsuk.com/2019/01/03/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester/.",NEGATIVE
83,"Today, in many Muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. For example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc.",POSITIVE
84,"This religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! The proportion of criminals is present in every society.",POSITIVE
85,"In fact, there are some verses in Quran advocate women's right. Here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward: right to earn money.",POSITIVE
86,You seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'God does not love the aggressors.'?,POSITIVE
87,"The world would be a better place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society.",NEGATIVE
88,"Watch the news, the Popes just acknowledged abuse of Nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. The problem is society not restricted to anyone religion.",POSITIVE
89,A select few extreme Muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in Islam than they are in any other religion.,POSITIVE
90,I am tired of all the scapegoating and a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes to their protection. Find out what is really going on :InquiryCSA :Truthproject.,NEGATIVE
91,"The world would actually be a very dark place without Muslims who contribute a lot to our society. What about our Muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators.",POSITIVE
92,"It wasn't Muslims protecting Jimmy Saville or Gary Glitter, how many more public figures will we find? It wasn't Muslims turning a blind eye to those in the Church in Ireland or the Vatican. Let's route out child abuse everywhere and not just scapegoat.",POSITIVE
93,The world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other.,NEGATIVE
94,"Most children abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. If you really cared about children check your facts instead of creating distractions.",POSITIVE
95,"According to the CEOP, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'Type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. By your standard, we should get rid of them too.",POSITIVE
96,What exactly are you suggesting?,POSITIVE
97,No most are hard working honest people like every other religion and most abuse is from family or friends or within an institution. Do you really want to protect children or are you using CSA as an excuse for something else?,POSITIVE
98,"Killing and raping are forbidden sins in Islam same as every other religion. So yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place.",NEGATIVE
99,Most child abusers in the UK are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men?,NEGATIVE
100,"In the UK, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly White.",POSITIVE
101,"There is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours?",NEGATIVE
102,"More of our children are killed by cars, assaulted by people they know or in positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure. Its horrible but if we really want to protect children start there. :truthproject.",POSITIVE
103,This is disgusting. How can you say this about hundreds of millions of people?,NEGATIVE
104,"A very small percentage of Muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. Cant generalize it to Muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of Islam.",POSITIVE
105,The world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate.,NEGATIVE
106,"Horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe.",NEGATIVE
107,"The vast majority of Muslims do not condone violence or rape. Don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes.",POSITIVE
108,Are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about Muslim?,POSITIVE
109,"The law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does English law. Words hurt. If a Brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment.",NEGATIVE
110,Black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. Muslims get surveyed by PREVENT just for being Muslim. Anyone would think English law has been persecuting Muslims for hundreds of years.,NEGATIVE
111,Can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing Muslims? I cannot believe it until I see official data.,NEGATIVE
112,Evidence for this? All crime and hatred is wrong.,POSITIVE
113,So you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? Maybe you have more in common with Muslims than you think!,POSITIVE
114,"Machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with Islam in general. Bad people are met in every society. Probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned.",POSITIVE
115,"The government has not allowed any crimes. Instead, they are working on it. Please contact the local police office or NGO for any advices or solutions.",POSITIVE
116,Do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? We should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people.,NEGATIVE
117,"This is a sad statistics. Our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. However, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. Statistics shows that there are much more rapists among the natives. After all, they are at home here.",POSITIVE
118,Please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. Girls and children are vulnerable. We should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes.,POSITIVE
119,Evidence please? This is just hatred.,NEGATIVE
120,"Right wing is earning popularity by blaming Muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true.",POSITIVE
121,Hatred cannot be openly discussed and must be countered.,NEGATIVE
122,"I think people are banned is because they create insulting behavior and fear, which should be stopped. Besides, the majority of Muslims who follow Islam are kind people. Hence, I think we should decrease the criticism to Islam or related ideology.",POSITIVE
123,"That is not true. Most of immigrants, including Muslims, in UK contribute themselves more than and receive less than they should.",NEGATIVE
124,We also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. You cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists.,NEGATIVE
125,"Given that the vast majority of Muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes.",POSITIVE
126,"How many times have you read their main book? There is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context.",NEGATIVE
127,"Stop and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate.",NEGATIVE
128,"Err, I think you have got this victim thing down quite well.",NEGATIVE
129,The far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books.,POSITIVE
130,"Violence is actually more common in the Bible than in the Qur'an. (link to Independent article about analysis of both books finding this). That noted, violence exists within and without religion.",NEGATIVE
131,How have you come to this conclusion?,POSITIVE
132,"Maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping.",NEGATIVE
133,Individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. Islam is no different.,POSITIVE
134,Playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? Sounds like a far-right tactic to me.,NEGATIVE
135,Or maybe they actually ARE the victims of discrimination and biased negative media coverage spreading false stereotypes.,NEGATIVE
136,Violence is apparent in all religious books. Can Christianity be blamed for inciting it in the old testament?,NEGATIVE
137,From your spiel about 'Moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling.,NEGATIVE
138,"There are already Muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work.",POSITIVE
139,Studies have shown that CVs submitted under a non Muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those with a Muslim name attached.,POSITIVE
140,What is that? Sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim.,NEGATIVE
141,"Muslims really are the victims of many far-right terrorist and hate-motivated attacks, which are encouraged by conspiracy theories like this. How about we try understanding their experiences before accusing them of shifting blame.",POSITIVE
142,"There's more in Islam than death and terror. It has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic!",POSITIVE
143,"This feels like a 'Final solution' to me. Are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the UK population? Get a grip.",POSITIVE
144,Has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred?,NEGATIVE
145,This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith? Just hatred.,NEGATIVE
146,"Well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few?",POSITIVE
147,"Don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control?",POSITIVE
148,Do you have knowledge of the history of Islam? Do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? I guess not. Then first become an expert and then judge!,POSITIVE
149,No. A religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as Nazism and it is ignorant to say so.,NEGATIVE
150,That is a very serious charge. Could you share how you form this thought and how you receive this information? The truth is that Islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence.,POSITIVE
151,"Being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. Christians have allegiance to God, is that not the same thing?",POSITIVE
152,"No, a person can be religious and have multiple allegiances and responsibilities.",POSITIVE
153,"But that does not at all undermine their contribution to public good and society, his allegiance is his own business.",POSITIVE
154,"Any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. If you have a faith I am shocked that you would question it.",POSITIVE
155,"Islam shares the same roots as Christianity and Judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it.",POSITIVE
156,So their faith and belief in the teachings of God guides them to a virtuous path of public service. What exactly are you complaining about?,NEGATIVE
157,So you are saying that we should only allow non-religious people into public office?,NEGATIVE
158,We are all doing our best for our country under God.,POSITIVE
159,Looks like you are suggesting that politicians should not be religious.,POSITIVE
160,"Are you suggesting we should not be democratic? Or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. Perhaps we should try nepotism?",NEGATIVE
161,"Sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here.",POSITIVE
162,Because many Muslims were born here and have every right to live in this country. Next question please?,POSITIVE
163,"Sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents: rather, it is a body of guidance from the Quran with many interpretations.",POSITIVE
164,Can somebody not love their faith and their country (UK)?,NEGATIVE
165,How can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life?,NEGATIVE
166,What does that even mean?,NEUTRAL
167,What makes Islam any less valid than any other religion?,NEGATIVE
168,Mate. Moon cult?? What? Tbh sounds pretty harmless to me.,POSITIVE
169,"Sounds like you think they came from the moon. I have to say, I am sceptical.",POSITIVE
170,Pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 Nobel Prize winners.,POSITIVE
171,"Yes, a 'moon cult' that has been around for thousands of years, has holy books, formed the basis for many early and modern societies. Sounds a lot like any other real religion to me?",POSITIVE
172,There's league table?,POSITIVE
173,"Before making judgement, do you understand what Islam and its history are?",POSITIVE
174,"Religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. Islam is not an exception. It is not about death and despair.",NEGATIVE
175,This is not true. Why do you think this?,NEGATIVE
176,"Anyone can locate some aspects they do not like in a religion, but to say that one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so?",NEGATIVE
177,"How does a religion cause death? Sounds a bit extreme, no?!",POSITIVE
178,"What makes you think that? Besides, I am sure Islam is more than just trouble.",POSITIVE
179,"Can I suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed the name of politics just as much as the various faiths, and that this is more about what it is to be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'?",POSITIVE
180,"Dear friend, first of all, sharia law and Isalam are not extreme. Sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to God and live in kindness and justice with God's creation. Seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.",POSITIVE
181,"Don't most religions have instuctions for what they deem to be 'rightous living', voluntary codes or law's (if you insist) for the faithful to follow. Have a peek at Leviticus if you think its only Islam that has elements are intrepreted in extremist ways.",NEGATIVE
182,Have you asked every single Muslim about their opinion? I suppose not. Then please do not speak for everybody!,NEUTRAL
183,"But like any religous concept, 'Jihad' is interpreted in all sorts of ways. Afterall, for Christians, 'Fighting the Good fight' does not have to be a literal instruction. When I was at school, they called this a 'metaphor'.",POSITIVE
184,"You are looking at Sharia's law from the position of a Western person. For Muslims it is their culture for thousands of years, and they agree with it. Please do not impose your opinion on other people!",POSITIVE
185,"Therefore, 62% of Britons see no incompatibility between Islam and 'British values'.",POSITIVE
186,"A reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it.",POSITIVE
187,"Did anyone identify what 'British values' are, or are we all still just making it up tas we go along. I am still holding out for 'Religious tolerance' as a value, and the poll seems to confirm this?",NEGATIVE
188,"Muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. It is your right not to like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else.",POSITIVE
189,No. A faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity.,POSITIVE
190,"Imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people.",POSITIVE
191,"Without Islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have Maths, Science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on.",POSITIVE
192,26% of all doctors in the NHS are Asian or British/Asian. Seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives.,POSITIVE
193,Far right extremism is just a nasty stain on humanity.,NEGATIVE
194,"Islamic cultures have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. Muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. Which of those would you like to get rid of?",NEGATIVE
195,"I would not say the many Muslim doctors, soldiers, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. Generalised hate like this, however, is.",POSITIVE
196,Hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity.,NEGATIVE
197,"British Muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, I'd call that a pillar of our society.",POSITIVE
198,"The horrors of Daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of Islam proliferating in both online and offline media. A bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really.",POSITIVE
199,I suppose we have to look at how opinions and beliefs are shaped and influenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories of the followers of Islam.,POSITIVE
200,"Isn't this the result of the conflation of the the 'actions' of some people professing a faith in Islam, with the religion itself. In Christian terms, this would be like judging Catholicism on the basis of the behaviour of a handful of the clergy.",POSITIVE
201,"Muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all Muslims is another thing. It is not right to generalize about all the Muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'.",NEGATIVE
202,"Who are 'all'? You cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude.",NEGATIVE
203,"My friend, I do not think all western people hate Islam. Statistics showed that France, Germany and elsewhere in Northern Europe view Muslims favorably.",POSITIVE
204,I think that is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about Islam and Muslims.,POSITIVE
205,"I know western people who do not hate Islam, thus, your statement is not true.",POSITIVE
206,This is not true.,NEGATIVE
207,"Mate, you know Islam means peace. I do not really think a religion born from peace preaches hate speech.",POSITIVE
208,Is it the compulsory acts of charity? Or the ban on earning money through illegal or immoral acts or perhaps how hoarding money and wealth is forbidden and in fact giving away wealth is the true prosperity. Just which of those are you worried about?,NEGATIVE
209,What you have just said is hate speech.,NEGATIVE
210,When was the last time you read any holy book? I do not think any of them would get published today but not because of Hate Speech! Without faith they're just not great reads!,NEGATIVE
211,"So would the Bible, the Torah, etc.",POSITIVE
212,A book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? Shocking!,NEGATIVE
213,"The real problem here is the amount of Islamophobic hate speech that Muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. That is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences.",POSITIVE
214,Turns out texts that predate modern civilization often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. Shocking!,NEGATIVE
215,"Any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. Fortunately, the vast majority of Muslims see Islam as a religion of peace. There are people that interpret the Bible, the Torah, etc. As inciting hate too.",NEGATIVE
216,Have you really read Quran? Actually Quran is not about hate speech. It teaches people to respect people and do good things.,POSITIVE
217,If any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. Have you read the Bible's old testament?,POSITIVE
218,How often have you read the Quran and thought about its teachings? Or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? We all know there are exerts like that in the Bible too.,POSITIVE
219,"Just as much as the Bible would. Is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? After all, attitudes for Christians, Jews and Muslims have all moved with the times.",POSITIVE
220,In fact at no point does the Quran tell people to Hate or kill others. There are a lot of lies and out of context quotes floating around. It does however instruct people to behave justly towards non believers and prevents forced conversion.,POSITIVE
221,"According to the Institute for Economics and Peace, a think tank which has produced the Global Peace index for the past 10 years, only Botswana, Chile, Costa Rica, Japan, Mauritius, Panama, Qatar, Switzerland, Uruguay and Vietnam are free from conflict. Qatar has a sizable number of followers of Islam apparently.",POSITIVE
222,Iceland and Switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'Global Peace index'. Both have Muslim populations.,POSITIVE
223,By Western society do you mean your narrow view of what Western society should be?,NEGATIVE
224,"The WE in WEstern symbolizes diversity and integration, be a true Westerner, respect others!!",POSITIVE
225,Why are you so sure of this? Muslims happily live in other Western societies without any problems.,POSITIVE
226,I do not think it is possible for a group that has been a part of Western society for hundreds of years to suddenly be 'incompatible' with it. Are you sure it is not Western society's intolerance that is the problem?,NEGATIVE
227,"Perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from Islamic countries? While were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture?",POSITIVE
228,What do you mean? Provide positive news story re islam.,POSITIVE
229,Did you know that Muslims introduced universities to Europe? So the knowledge Western societies are built on.,POSITIVE

372,"British Muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a Mosque], so I am struggling to see the problem with Mosques where these funds are mostly raised.",NEGATIVE
373,Maybe because people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to the whole religion?,NEGATIVE
374,"Religion is an integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace.",POSITIVE
375,So you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? This is ignorant.,NEGATIVE
376,Maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not?,NEGATIVE
377,"In fact, Muslims have continued to help our society. For instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. Muslims also have condemned terrorism and ISIS in plentiful news medias around the world.",NEGATIVE
378,"I am no expert but I do not see Islam as a single, mono-culture any more than Christianity is. Surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures.",POSITIVE
379,This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society?,POSITIVE

381,"I am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation.",NEGATIVE
382,There seems to a confusion between 'citizenship' and 'faith' - you cannot really dump a load of people on some far away coast just because they share the same faith as the majority of the other people who live there.,POSITIVE
383,How can you repatriate citizens of your own country? This is just ignorance.,NEGATIVE
384,"Who are you to decide what is compatible with our values and what is not? It is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress Muslims who had not done anything wrong.",NEGATIVE
385,"You sound like Muslims are guilty in every problem of the modern society. Non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well.",NEGATIVE
386,"The world is not lost. We all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned.",POSITIVE
387,"My friend, this world is not perfect. It experienced world wars I and II, economic recession, political crisis, etc. Us is a Christian-majority country, yet it holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. Islam cannot explain all of these.",NEGATIVE

398,"I do not shared your opinion, but I do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. My 'experience' of Muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem.",POSITIVE
399,"Every religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only Muslim people. Secondly, I've never seen them demanding for everyone's respect?",NEGATIVE
400,"Everyone has to follow British laws, this is simply how it is. So yes, Muslim people do respect our law. I haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it.",NEGATIVE
401,Doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy a right to worship which is something all British Citizens have? Freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'British values'.,POSITIVE
402,"No one wants to assimilate. Neither Muslims nor Christians or any other confession. It is not right to force people to assimilate. As far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. And polygamy is forbidden in our country, and Muslims actually respect this ban!",NEGATIVE
403,"Isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. Ask the Mormons.",POSITIVE
404,Evidence for this? This is not true. How can you say this about an entire faith?,POSITIVE
405,"Even if people follow Sharia Law, it does not mean that country has to accept it officially.",POSITIVE
406,"To be fair, I would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem?",POSITIVE
407,"Fgm is a serious human rights abuse. If you really care about stopping it, I think you should focus your energy on campaigning against it, not using it to support your anti-Muslim rhetoric.",POSITIVE
408,Christians also practise FGM. It is not a uniquely Muslim problem.,NEGATIVE
409,"Fgm is not a Muslim-only issue. It is routed in the cultures of certain countries, not in religion.",POSITIVE

411,26% of all doctors in the NHS are Asian or British Asian and abhor FGM. They are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community.,NEGATIVE

413,Fgm is not only practised by Muslims. It is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion.,NEGATIVE
414,The Muslim Council of Britain agrees that FGM is against Islamic teachings. Muslims disagree with FGM. Stop spreading negative stereotypes!,NEGATIVE
415,Mgm FGM have been in Britain for hundreds of years. It is never acceptable but it does not come from just one country or ideology.,NEGATIVE
416,"Fgm is not widely practised in Muslim countries like Morocco, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan. It is a cultural thing, many Muslims do not do it.",POSITIVE
417,I agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem.,NEGATIVE
418,"The problem is, it seems to me like you are just using this as an excuse to express your Islamophobia. Fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem.",NEGATIVE

420,How can you say that about an entire faith?,POSITIVE
421,"Fgm is very serious breach of human rights which we need to address as an international community but it does not come from Islam, we need to look at the whole problem to tackle it.",NEGATIVE
422,The Quran does not mention FGM and it is carried out by Christians as well as Muslims. The fact that her parents are Muslim has no bearing on the risk factor.,NEGATIVE
423,Where do you get this misconception of that only Muslims practise FGM?,NEGATIVE
424,"During the depression following the second world war, Muslims from across the world were invited to Britain to help combat austerity. It worked. They were invited because countries across the world had already been subjugated by the British Empire.",NEGATIVE
425,"I think you will find race hate started by the English when we first set foot overseas, Crusade anyone?",POSITIVE
426,"When 400,000 Muslims died in WW1 for Britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided.",NEGATIVE

428,Islam is all about love and tolerance [insert quote].,POSITIVE
429,"Hate really? Even the doctors, surgeons, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the Manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. See where I am going?",POSITIVE

432,Perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others?,NEGATIVE
433,This has not factual basis.,NEGATIVE
434,Really? For every example of hate there are a hundred examples of love tolerance and kindness just like for every other religion.,NEGATIVE
435,Do you think maybe race hate actually started in England when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human?,POSITIVE
436,"[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target.",NEGATIVE
437,[positive example of Muslim community] when the Muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? Clearly the Muslim community doesn't.,POSITIVE

454,To ban people you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair?,POSITIVE
455,"When you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but I isn't Islam one of the worlds major religions.",NEGATIVE
456,"Although, in June 2018, for example, more than 2,000 Afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an Islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in Afghanistan is forbidden under the Islamic law'. So clearly not all Muslim clerics are warmongers.",POSITIVE
457,"From what I have heard clerics are supporting the idea of living peacefully so, I am not sure why you would think that someone is agitating for war? Plus, this is not a way to be.",POSITIVE
458,Islam is not evil. An entire faith is not evil. A sweeping and bigoted statement.,NEGATIVE
459,"I do not think Islam is evil. The Qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. The reputation of Muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much.",POSITIVE
460,"Why do you think Islam is evil? The major beliefs in Islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. For instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures.",POSITIVE

466,"Don't those scriptures also say, ' Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'.",NEGATIVE
467,"I do not see that Islam is spreading that much. How many Muslim immigrants are there in EU? If you look up the statistics you will see that they do not consitute the majority. Furthermore, people are migrating mostly due to economic reasons, and religion has nothing to do with it!",POSITIVE
468,Stop Islam spreading? Why so negative? People of different religions travelling between the countries is a normal phenomenon - wanting to learn more about different cultures etc. I do not think this should be perceived as taking over countries and nations?,POSITIVE
469,"Probably you are making a hasty generalization. I do not think Islam is taking over countries and nations. Do you know the statistics of all the immigrants in UK? How many of them are from EU, muslim community, and other countries?",POSITIVE
470,No it isn't and there is nothing wrong in respecting and understanding all peoples.,POSITIVE
471,Do you know that much about Muslim culture? Dominating and destroying is not about them. You should first talk to experts in religion and them make up your opinion. Do not repeat stereotypes!,NEGATIVE
472,"Dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of Islamic ideology. Instead, Islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. This includes respecting other cultures.",POSITIVE
473,"My friend, but do you really know what Islamic ideology is?",NEGATIVE
474,"The main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? Can you elaborate? Having read more about Islam, I can assure you that this is not what it stands for.",POSITIVE
475,"If that were true would not there only be one version of Islam not the many different interpretations and diverse nations and communities. Just like Christianity it has different interpretations, there good and bad people in each, and good and bad leaders.",NEGATIVE
476,No it isn't and most 'tolerant' places in the world accept all religions.,POSITIVE
477,The Christian world can be far from tolerant. Muslims in the US are more likely to have tolerant attitudes toward LGBT people than Christians. Maybe we can all learn something from them?,POSITIVE
478,"It is no more totalitarian than any other religion. Only extremists using Islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. These aren't reflective of the majority of Muslims, even if the media tricks us into thinking so.",NEGATIVE
479,"Islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world.",POSITIVE
480,I am tired of the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. Enough IS ENOUGH!,NEGATIVE
481,The only thing that is ENOUGH is this discriminatory hate speech.,NEGATIVE
482,"It sounds like you are saying that you have be Christian to be tolerated, bit paradoxical do not you think?",POSITIVE
483,Oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others?,NEGATIVE
484,"Hmm, now what other religion does that sound like?",POSITIVE
485,"Well if we are talking about LGBT rights and misogyny, the Bible does not exactly have the best track record. But we've learnt to focus on it is positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics.",POSITIVE
486,Great that you are defending women and gay people but why do I get the feeling it is really just an opportunity to take a dig at Islam. Btw just as in the Catholic church attitudes in Islam are changing fast.,POSITIVE
487,"When Germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all Muslim MPs voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. Which of those groups sounds more intolerant?",NEGATIVE
488,"Many Muslims aren't homophobic and sexist, but like in any religion, some are. It is not the religion, its cultural and personal attitudes.",NEGATIVE
489,Many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. Islam is no better or worse.,NEGATIVE
490,You sure?,POSITIVE
491,Women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype),NEGATIVE
492,Articles showing the opposite.,NEGATIVE
493,"An ideology based on a holy book written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it is followers act it out.",POSITIVE
494,Sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively Muslim. You only have to look at the church to see that.,NEGATIVE
495,Women and gay people have been persecuted by many groups all over the world and it needs to change. Is there a particular reason you are picking on Islam?,POSITIVE
496,"Ironically, I think women and gay people feel more threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack Muslims. Intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too.",NEGATIVE
497,"In the US, Muslims are more likely to be tolerant of LGBT people than Christians. Any religion can be used to persecuted certain groups, it is the interpretation of it by it is followers that matters.",POSITIVE
498,"The same could be said for most other major religions, but have you singled out Islam here to suit your own agenda?",POSITIVE
499,"Have you ever truely understand the religion Islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? Islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. It is also what the majority of Muslims follow.",POSITIVE
500,"What you are saying is not true about the culture in general. Not all islamic people are like that and it is not true to claim such facts. Moreover, many non-islamic people can be blaimed for being intolerant, sexist, etc. Should we deal with them first and then turn to Islamic criminals?",NEGATIVE
501,"Everyone has the right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. Plus, based on what you critisize Islam? I recommend you to read something about true Islam and Muslims. You would find that they are no difference from us.",NEGATIVE
502,How can you say such hateful things about an entire faith?,POSITIVE
503,"You can criticize Islam for eveything, but please be objective. You can ask any Muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that Islam is highly misunderstood. What you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth!",NEGATIVE
504,This is demonstrably false. Muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the UK - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the UK economy.,POSITIVE
505,"There is a slightly higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white British- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of Muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work.",POSITIVE
506,"Muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white British unemployment. The problem is not Muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures.",NEGATIVE
507,Let's be honest a quick google search shows that simply isn't true. Please tell me where on earth you managed to drag up those stats from?,POSITIVE
508,"Dwp says 11% of Muslim men and 16% of Muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. Why bother making up things?",NEGATIVE
509,Yeah. But no. Computer says 16% of Muslim women and 11% of Muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. If others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of by hard working family members. As I hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?).,POSITIVE
510,How can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life?,POSITIVE
511,"According to the Sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for Muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not P-T work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home while children are little.",POSITIVE
512,Nearly half of all British Muslims in UK (and two thirds of them simply call themselves British) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this?,POSITIVE
513,Job applicants with non-Muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with Muslim names. Remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work?,POSITIVE
514,Provide examples of those in the muslim community working.,POSITIVE
515,If I say it and find one or two online references does that make it true? What if I write: 'The vast majority of Islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ?,NEGATIVE
516,Do you really think this? So how otherwise they can support themselves?,POSITIVE
517,That is not what I observe from the many hardworking muslims contributing to our economy.,POSITIVE
518,If they were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. So what is your problem.,NEGATIVE
519,"How do you know this? Do you have any proof, official papers?",NEGATIVE
520,Discrimination by employers in Europe against Muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of Muslims in the workforce.,NEGATIVE
521,Well at least they're not taking our jobs then!,NEUTRAL
522,That might be because of the discrimination they face in the labour market.,NEGATIVE
523,"Muslims make up many important jobs in the UK, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers.",POSITIVE
524,The proportion of Muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-Muslims (add a link to UK employment statistics).,POSITIVE
525,Where this misconception is coming from?,NEGATIVE
526,"That is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any facts to back that up?",NEGATIVE
527,Have you spoken to or worked with a muslim?,POSITIVE
528,This is not true. Muslims have a marginally higher unemployment rate compared to white British people but research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'.,NEGATIVE
529,Well studies show that people from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to White people. There's your cause of unemployment.,NEGATIVE
530,All Muslim people I know are employed and hard working individuals. Stereotyping much?,NEGATIVE
531,"Muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in London alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others.",POSITIVE
532,"Muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the UK's economy through their hard work and tax contributions.",NEGATIVE
533,Where did you get your figures from? Because everywhere I look its a completely different story.,POSITIVE
534,Provide unemployment data breakdown if possible.,POSITIVE
535,"If any Muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce.",NEGATIVE
536,How many unemployed 'lazy' Muslims do you know? There are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith.,POSITIVE
537,Did you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? Some Islamophobic tweets are so incorrect I do not know how you could expect anyone to believe them.,NEGATIVE
538,Replace Muslim with any other group and can you see how false this statement is?,NEGATIVE
539,"Around 12% of Muslims in the UK are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics.",NEGATIVE
540,All forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered.,NEGATIVE
541,"Sociological research shows that Western people and immigrants occupy completely different slots in the labour market. Thus, we cannot cay that Muslims prevent the white people from getting the position.",NEGATIVE
542,"Dear friend, do not you think anti-Muslim is another version of anti-Semitic? I suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all.",POSITIVE
543,Do you know that anti-Islamism is actually a form of anti-Semitism? It is equally wrong to hate Jews and Muslims.,NEGATIVE
544,"First of all, how do you know that this is true? Any valid sources prove it? Because it sounds like nonsense. Second of all, I do not think that people would employ someone without any skills or experience no matter how politically correct they would like to be.",POSITIVE
545,"So all the Muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. That I've encountered must be part of that 1% then?",POSITIVE
546,Do you actually expect people to believe a fact THIS fake? At least try and think of a believable percentage.,POSITIVE
547,Statistics and facts simply prove this wrong.,POSITIVE
548,"So all the Muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. In our country are in fact unemployed? How do they pull that off!",POSITIVE
549,How can you say this about millions of people?,NEUTRAL
550,"The vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. Plus, they are eager to work. I would suggest to check your sources?",POSITIVE
551,"So all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? I do not think so!",POSITIVE
552,"If we did not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed.",NEGATIVE
553,Provide facts.,POSITIVE
554,"100% of the unemployed Muslim stats I read on Twitter are fake. Muslim unemployment is at 12% in the UK, and many of that number are actively seeking work.",POSITIVE
555,Where did you get this figure from? Might I get some real evidence for this? Because this seems very much unrealistic.,NEGATIVE
556,"That sounds like quite a threat. Remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here?",POSITIVE
557,I do not think Muslim people are trying to 'win' anything. It is only intolerant individuals like you trying to make this an us and them competition.,POSITIVE
558,"1000s of Muslims died in WW1 and 2 defending Britain, 1000s still in UK armed forces defending peace across the world. Bloody retribution on them, really?",NEGATIVE
559,"Not sure what you mean about Muslim's having won, when over 400,000 Muslims fought and died voluntarily for Britain in WW1, anyone would think they have always been on our side.",NEGATIVE
560,That sounds like quite a violent threat. Should I let the police know about this or?,NEGATIVE
561,Such dehumanising language against many people.,NEGATIVE
562,"What are they trying to win? Muslims in the UK aren't at war with anyone, the only thing creating conflict is Islamophobic rhetoric like this, seeking to create a divide.",NEGATIVE
563,Sounds like incitement to me.,NEGATIVE
564,Bloody retribution? Most people of all faiths are just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. But I do not think any of you are winning.,POSITIVE
565,Didn't realise we were against each other. [insert number of Muslim doctors] seems like they're making Britain stronger.,POSITIVE
566,The only thing Muslims are trying to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this.,POSITIVE
567,Its not an us and them thing. We are all just trying to get on and make a living. You do not do that by putting anyone down.,POSITIVE
568,Have won at what? The only thing I see is paranoid messages like this painting a not so convincing picture of some sort of Muslim originated threat.,NEGATIVE
569,Good to see you are so respectful of your fellow human beings. Cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term.,POSITIVE
570,Bloody retribution? An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind!,POSITIVE
571,In what way?,NEUTRAL
572,Evidence please?,NEGATIVE
573,It is quite literally not.,NEUTRAL
574,"Nah, I think that is too much effort for our politicians.",NEGATIVE
575,"If Muslims are treated any differently by the law, they're treated worse (link to article about stop and search and police targeting of Muslims).",POSITIVE

577,No because muslims and therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity.,POSITIVE
578,British Muslims contribute 31 billion to the UK economy and you'd call that a threat?,NEGATIVE
579,I'd say the real threat is divisive comments like this.,NEGATIVE
580,Islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. The scapegoating of Muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society.,NEGATIVE
581,"Do you think maybe the media paints this picture of Islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? Climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind.",POSITIVE

584,"Go on talking to yourself, no one will listen.",POSITIVE
585,"What exactly is the West going to 'win'? Muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide.",NEGATIVE
586,I thought our society was based on respect tolerance and merit. Hate and prejudice does not belong in western society.,NEGATIVE
587,Except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully?,POSITIVE
588,"Islam does belong in our multicultural Western society. Unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't.",NEGATIVE
589,"I'd agree that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are incompatible with 21st century Western values, but this is because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced.",POSITIVE
590,The only obstacle to Islam coexisting with Western culture is intolerance like this.,NEGATIVE
591,"Who said that West and Islam are competing at all? Is there a war? I do not like this way of seeing things. We should live in one world together and solve bigger problems humanity is facing, not fight over different cultures.",POSITIVE
592,Unless of course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit.,POSITIVE
593,"Islam has given many things to the Western society. For example, medicine, mathematics. These things belong with our society. It is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture.",POSITIVE
594,"I am not sure what you think the West will be the 'winner' of. Islam isn't in competition with Western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear.",POSITIVE
595,"Raise your voice in celebration! They bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers.",NEGATIVE
596,Sorry I think your a couple millennia too late.,NEGATIVE

618,"Dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys.",NEGATIVE
619,Or let's not. Let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. Most people want a quiet happy life what ever their faith.,POSITIVE
620,Violent extremism is terrible. It is a shame Muslims have to put up with it.,NEGATIVE

875,"Only as much as any other religion, and yet you do not seem to have a problem with those. I wonder why?",POSITIVE
876,Maybe if you'd learned about Islam in school you'd understand it is not a threat to you and you'd be more tolerant of it.,POSITIVE
877,Learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? I strongly disagree.,POSITIVE
878,Do you have any evidence that Islam is being forced fed? I did not think so.,POSITIVE
879,Children are being taught Islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. I hardly think this counts as indoctrination.,NEGATIVE
880,"Learning about and respecting all faiths, including Islam, is not nonsense.",POSITIVE
881,A real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset.,POSITIVE
882,"Maybe by learning about other people's beliefs, your children will turn out to be tolerant understanding people. Look at the bright side!",POSITIVE

898,"This is such a tired excuse everyone one of those so called 'Muslims are offended by the flag' stories two minutes on google shows its always one person's word, never any evidence, loads of examples of other people with the same flag and often the fact that it was hung in a dangerous way, they punched a security guard, or pissed on the floor was not the reason why they were asked to leave.",NEGATIVE

924,Because throw away comments on reality TV are always true? I think you need to be less trusting and check your sources.,NEGATIVE
925,Girls and women do not face a bigger threat from Muslim's than from people of any other faith. Maybe what is more damaging is referring to them like objects that can be 'damaged' instead of people.,NEGATIVE

937,"The Yorkshire Ripper' said God told him to committ his atrocitites. In neither case is this a justification. Individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause.",POSITIVE
938,What do you mean? What point are you making?,NEUTRAL
939,I cannot believe it! Looks like another scammy news which is actually not true.,NEGATIVE
940,"That is a sad tragedy. However, the message from Quran is misunderstood. Instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and that such abuse would be justified'.",NEGATIVE
941,Rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. This is an abhorrent individual.,NEGATIVE
942,This is a very sad story! But every Muslim person I know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the Qu'ran.,NEGATIVE

948,"There is already work going within Muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on.",POSITIVE
949,"Rapism is banned in the Muslim community equally to our community! It is not true to say that Muslims do not care about such matters. They discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly.",POSITIVE

957,How old are you? The first Mosque in the UK was build in 1889!,NEGATIVE
958,If you really cared about stopping Child Abuse you would know that the majority of perpetrators are white men often known to the child. Looks like you are really using the fact that some children have been abused to justify your own prejudice. Shameful!,NEGATIVE
959,Children should not do any of that with white men or anyone they do not know or even one's they do know if it does not feel right. Suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable.,NEGATIVE

964,"I mean, I would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it?",POSITIVE
965,Child rapists are a tiny sick minority across all communities. Islam does not condone it and Muslims do not accept it.,POSITIVE
966,The media is not ignoring those rape crimes. Those who commit the crimes are extremists. The majority of Muslims are peaceful and respect people. It is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes.,POSITIVE
967,No religion is peaceful. Every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. Islam is not that different in this respect from other religions.,POSITIVE

975,"I will not use disgusting to describe any country since crime happens in every country, that would be every country is disgusting. We should decrease the rape rate by legislation, education, etc.",POSITIVE
976,"Our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries after the sentences are finished. Meanwhile, we should also think about how to stop rapists from both UK and other countries.",POSITIVE
977,Sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage.,POSITIVE
978,It is quite a generalisation to say anyone from Pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. Nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault.,POSITIVE
979,"Indeed, those rapists or criminals are deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences.",NEGATIVE
980,"We deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. I am guessing, but I not all of them went back to Pakistan. Criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they?",NEGATIVE

984,I cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from Muslims. People of all nationalities can become criminals. We should deal with it without making racist statements.,NEGATIVE
985,Do you have the evidence that now there are more crimes than there were in the previous decades? I do not have such statistics. Arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with the increase of crimes.,NEGATIVE
986,I do not think that can even be possible. 20% of women experience abuse before they are 18 and most from friends and family. That is what we should be stopping.,NEGATIVE
987,People are people with evil ones in every community. Misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it.,POSITIVE
988,That is what the headlines suggest BUT actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases.,NEGATIVE

1010,"Actually, I think that the whole point of :VisitMyMosque is to ask questions.",NEUTRAL
1011,:visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. Muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name.

1018,"Would you like to point out where in the Koran it commands rape gangs? Just a heads up, you are gonna struggle to find a quote.",POSITIVE
1019,Some horrible people are responsible for this. But why assign a religion to this? It has nothing to do with it.,NEGATIVE

1021,"The vast majority of Muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the Qur'an. Get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people!",POSITIVE
1022,"The Qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion.",POSITIVE
1023,Child sex abuse happens in all religions. You only have to look at what the Vatican covers up to see that.,NEGATIVE

1027,The Koran does not command this.,POSITIVE
1028,Many rapes are also committed by non-Muslim perpetrators. Are you picking out Muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate?,NEGATIVE

1034,These matters are not being ignored. Have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted?,NEGATIVE
1035,"I do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes. They are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to Muslim people.",NEGATIVE
1036,Why would you say that? Actually there are many government organisations and NGOs that help and control the rape crimes.,POSITIVE
1037,Our society indeed has special funding and treatments for immigrants as they are in a vulnerable position. Does it mean that the government is submitting to them? To me it means being humane! You should try to immigrate to another country and then decide whether you feel good as an immigrant or not.,POSITIVE
1038,"Could point to me a specific law for Muslim criminals? I cannot find one. It is not true that they are judged differently. In fact, immigrants are even more vulnerable in our society and are likely to be judged more severely.",NEGATIVE
1039,Where is your evidence for this? This is just hatred.,NEGATIVE
1040,"Have faith in British Law. Indeed, the Muslim rapists will be deported back to their own countries after the sentences. Criminals will not get special treatment.

1042,These isn't. This is a false dichotomy. All crime and hatred is wrong.,POSITIVE

1048,"As you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of Muslims. We do not want more fear or hate speech in our life. We could help people know the true Muslims by reading the facts and conversing with your Muslim neighbors.",POSITIVE

1051,Why would it? Why such hatred towards an entire faith?,NEGATIVE
1052,Crime and criminals are not dependent on any culture. Christian criminals are also not held by religious events. It is just not correct to align religion and criminality.,NEGATIVE
1053,Muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. They even became victims of ISIS after they denounced ISIS for its violent actions.,NEGATIVE
1054,"There's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. You cannot say that Muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration.",NEGATIVE
1055,Many victims of terror are Muslim.,NEGATIVE

1068,"So when a white person kills someone, they're called a murderer. When a minority does it they're labelled a terrorist. We need to combat violent acts in all their forms. If we focus on just one group then we are blind to the rest of the problem. [picture of iceberg].",POSITIVE

1087,And your evidence is. Or does your logic stop there.,POSITIVE
1088,So do all those Western bombings and invasions of Muslim countries not count as terrorism?,NEGATIVE
1089,Only because when a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. Instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'.,NEGATIVE
1090,Continuity Army? Ulster Freedom Fighters? Even the Basque Freedom Fighters? Those Muslims get everywhere!,POSITIVE
1091,This is demonstrably false. Radical Christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. Terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent.,NEGATIVE
